dim_customer,dim_market,dim_product

Fact table : It will have the data about the transactions
fact_forecast_monthly,fact_sales_monthly
      
# Importing data into PowerBi
As the database is MySQL in this project, we need to import the datasets from Mysql database to PowerBi by providing the Database access credential

# Data Model
Data modeling plays a vital role and is considered as the basement of report.<br>
All the visuals will be build upon the data model.<br>
Poor data modeling affects the over all performance of the report.<br>
Following Good practices of data modeling is must.<br>
In this project, we have followed Snowfall data modeling method.
